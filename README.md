### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Platform/DevOps Engineer specializing in Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and application deployments. I primarily work with GitHub Actions as my go-to CI platform and ArgoCD for streamlined, robust deployments. My focus is on creating seamless, automated workflows that empower teams to build and release software with speed and reliability.

- Off the clock, you'll find me wrestling Next.js and TypeScript projects, fitting things together in a TurboRepo monorepo. My love for automating anything that can be automated is so intense that even my Roomba is now considering filling out paperwork for stock options and a corner office. In fact, I've automated our household so much that my family are starting to wonder if they should speak in YAML to get my attention.
